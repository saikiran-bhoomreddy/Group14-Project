The first phase consits of extraction of data from the latest dataset available on github repository using webscraping tools like pypeteer.

Second part consisted of designing and training of model ( Sentiment Analysis Predictor) to find out the average no.of iterations required to come to a satisfactory resolution.

Third part,tried to design a accuracy model for sentimemt analysis predictor.

->Initial Part of the file contains Code used to load the the JSON data file from the DEVGPT file from GitHub.
->Second part of the code is used to install the libraries which are radon and lizard from Python, if they are not installed already.I had then written the logic part to find the complexities.
->Third part of the code is to print the average complexities of each code present in the given file by the user.
->Fourth part of the code is to print the average complexities of each programming language and displaying the results in the output.
->The last part of the code is to plot a graph based on the output results .

->Initial Part of the file contains Code used to pre-process the data and  the output of this code which was provided below this file in the main branch which is named as output.csv file
->Second part of the code is the Training Model which was designed to Get the Actual Output Required.
